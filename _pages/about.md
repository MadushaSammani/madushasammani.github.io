I spent my formative years in Galle, a city located near the southern coast of Sri Lanka. After completing my high school education, I pursued my bachelorâ€™s degree in surveying sciences from the faculty of Geomatics at the [Sabaragamuwa University of Sri Lanka](https://www.sab.ac.lk/). During my undergraduate studies, I mainly focused on remote sensing, GIS, and land surveying. It was during this time that I developed a keen interest in geospatial information technology. Later, I earned my MPS in Geospatial Information Science and Engineering from the [State University of New York College of Environment Science and Forestry](https://www.esf.edu/). During my master's degree program, I delved deeper into GIS and digital data processing. Currently, I am pursuing my Ph.D. in the Geography department at the [University of Alabama](https://www.ua.edu/). My research interests revolve around geospatial information technology and its applications in hazards and transportation. My dissertation focuses on using traffic simulation and fire spread models to develop data-driven community wildfire evacuation plans in the wildland-urban interface. My research aims to provide communities with the tools and resources to manage wildfire events effectively, thereby minimizing the loss of life and property.
